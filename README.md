# Good Grief

When mob griefing is set to false, Good Grief overrides the vanilla mob griefing rules by allowing some griefing events.

These include:
* Animal behaviors (sheep/rabbits eating, foxes stealing items, etc)
* Villagers farming
* Piglins bartering
* Snow golem trails

Disallowed events include:
* Creepers exploding blocks
* Endermen block theft
* Projectile explosions (ghast fireballs, wither skulls)

Good Grief has no effect while mob griefing is allowed.
